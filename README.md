### CippSharpCore-Coroutines
Parallel version of [OneShotCoroutine](https://github.com/Cippman/Unity-OneShotCoroutine.git).
Provides a different solution on 
how to run coroutines from 'statics' and 'structs',
and 'inactive' gameObjects.

### Content:
Contains the main code CoroutineUtils.cs,
(and few examples with 'tips')

### How to Install:
- Option 1 (readonly) now it supports Unity Package Manager so you can download by copy/paste the git url in 'Package Manager Window + Install From Git'. As said this is a readonly solution so you cannot access all files this way.
- Option 2 (classic) download this repository as .zip; Extract the files; Drag 'n' drop the extracted folder in your unity project (where you prefer).
- Option 3 (alternative) add this as submodule / separate repo in your project by copy/paste the git url
